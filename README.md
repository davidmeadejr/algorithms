# LeetCode Practise Log

I've set myself the challenge to "git gud" at Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) style questions and FAANG-style coding interviews by tackling the Blind 75 questions.Providing both a brute force (worst case scenario) and a most optimal (best case scenario) solution for each.

More questions will be added once I've solved all the Blind 75 questions.

## Excel Log Format

I am tracking my overall progress in an Excel spreadsheet, with each row dedicated to a single question and associated details. These details follow the categories listed below:

- **Category**: The key concept or category of the question (e.g., arrays, dynamic programming, etc.).
- **Question Name**: The title of the problem.
- **LeetCode Link**: The direct link to the LeetCode problem.
- **Pattern**: The underlying pattern to solve the question (e.g. two points etc...)
- **Brute Force Solution Link**: A link to my brute force solution.
- **Brute Force Approach**: A single-sentence overview of the brute force approach.
- **Brute Force Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the brute force approach.
- **Explanation of Brute Force Time Complexity**: A brief justification of the time complexity for the brute force solution.
- **Most Optimal Solution Link**: A link to my most optimal solution.
- **Most Optimal Approach**: A single-sentence overview of the optimal approach.
- **Most Optimal Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the optimal approach.
- **Explanation of Most Optimal Time Complexity**: A brief justification of the time complexity for the optimal solution.

## Individual Questions Log Format

Each question in both the 'brute force' and 'optimal' folders is accompanied by a .md file with the same name. These files contain:

- The underlying pattern to solve the question
- A single-sentence summary of summary of how to solve the solution
- Time complexity
- Reasoning for the time complexity
