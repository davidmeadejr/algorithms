pattern: nested loop
BF Solution: Use a "nested loop" to traverse the list, checking each pair of numbers; if the sum of two numbers equals the target, return their indices.
Time Complexity: 0(n^2) also known as quadratic time.
Reasoning for time complexity: If each element in the input requires a loop over all other elements, the time complexity is likely O(n^2).
