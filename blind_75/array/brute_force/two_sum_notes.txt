*pattern*: nested loop

*BF Solution*: Use a "nested loop" to traverse the list, checking each pair of numbers; if the sum of two numbers equals the target, return their indices.

*Time Complexity*: 0(n^2) also known as quadratic time.

*Time Complexity Explanation*: If each element in the input requires a loop over all other elements, the time complexity is likely O(n^2).
